DevOps and Kubernetes Lab Activity
This repository contains my work for a DevOps activity focused on containerization and orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes. The project demonstrates building a Node.js application, containerizing it with Docker, and deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster. Step-by-step commands, configuration files, and evidence screenshots are included to show the build, run, and testing processes.

Key features:

Docker image creation with a custom Dockerfile

Running and testing the app inside a Docker container

Kubernetes deployment and service configuration using k8s-deploy.yaml

Workflow documentation and terminal outputs as lab evidence

This repo is designed for students and beginners aiming to understand practical DevOps fundamentals including container setup, image management, and simple orchestration with Kubernetes.
